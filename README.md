## Challenge 1 - Working With Branch
The very first challenge we faced was working with branches
### Approach
We used Chat-GPT, StackOverFlow and YouTube to learn working with branches

### Algorithm
- First we gather images
- Then we implemented index.html file
- Then implemented CSS file
- Then implemented Java Script
- Then JQuery
- We put all our work in our respected branches
- Finally we push it into main branch
- At last we updated README.md file
### Code Implementation

### Complexity Analysis

Total of 14 files have been used and each file contains aproximate 50 lines some contain 500 to 600 lines of code.

### Assumptions
We assumed it as we have our real education institute and making a website for it.

## Challenge 2- Merge Conflict

We lost our data due to improper knowledge of git commands
Fortunately we had copy of the project in our local that we used later on and made changes and push it again.

## Challenge 3- Contributor Access
We are not able to find out how to allow anyone to contribute direcltly or restrict them.


## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone this repository in your local system
